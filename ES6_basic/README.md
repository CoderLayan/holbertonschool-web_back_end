# ES6 JavaScript Learning Project

This project is designed to help you learn and practice the key features introduced in ECMAScript 2015 (ES6). You'll explore new syntax, functionality, and best practices that make JavaScript development more efficient and expressive.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you will be able to:
- Explain what ES6 is and its significance
- Identify and use new ES6 features
- Differentiate between constants and variables
- Work with block-scoped variables
- Implement arrow functions and default parameters
- Utilize rest and spread operators
- Use template literals for string templating
- Create objects with enhanced property syntax
- Work with iterators and for-of loops

## ES6 Features Covered

### 1. Const vs Let
- `const`: Declares a block-scoped constant that cannot be reassigned
- `let`: Declares a block-scoped variable that can be reassigned

### 2. Block Scope
- Variables declared with `let` and `const` are limited to the block in which they are declared

### 3. Arrow Functions
- Shorter syntax for writing functions
- Lexical `this` binding (doesn't create its own `this` context)

### 4. Parameter Defaults
- Function parameters can have default values

### 5. Rest Parameter Syntax
- Allows representing an indefinite number of arguments as an array

### 6. Spread Syntax
- Expands iterables into individual elements

### 7. Template Literals
- String literals allowing embedded expressions and multi-line strings

### 8. Object Property Value Shorthand
- Shorter syntax for defining object properties

### 9. ES6 Method Properties
- Shorter syntax for defining methods in objects

### 10. For...of Loops
- Creates a loop iterating over iterable objects

### 11. Iterators
- Objects that define a sequence and potentially a return value upon completion

## Setup Instructions

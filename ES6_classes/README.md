# JavaScript ES6 Classes Project

This project focuses on mastering ES6 classes, inheritance, static methods, getters/setters, and metaprogramming concepts in JavaScript.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you will be able to:
- Define and implement classes in JavaScript
- Add methods, static methods, and computed method names to classes
- Extend classes using inheritance
- Understand and apply metaprogramming concepts with symbols
- Implement getters and setters for class properties
- Work with class hoisting behavior

## Key Concepts

### 1. Classes
ES6 introduced a cleaner, more familiar syntax for creating objects and dealing with inheritance.

### 2. Methods and Static Methods
- Instance methods: Available on class instances
- Static methods: Called on the class itself, not instances
- Computed method names: Use expressions as method names

### 3. Inheritance
- Use `extends` to create a subclass
- Use `super()` to call the parent constructor
- Override methods in subclasses

### 4. Getters and Setters
- Control access to object properties
- Add validation or computation when getting/setting values

### 5. Metaprogramming with Symbols
- Use symbols for unique property keys
- Implement well-known symbols like `Symbol.iterator`

### 6. Hoisting
- Class declarations are not hoisted like function declarations

## Project Structure

The project consists of implementing several classes with specific requirements:

### 0. You used to attend a place like this at some point
- Introduction to class implementation

### 1. Let's make some classrooms
- Implement a `ClassRoom` class

### 2. A Course, Getters, and Setters
- Create a `Course` class with getters and setters

### 3. Methods, static methods, computed methods names
- Implement various types of methods

### 4. Pricing
- Create a `Pricing` class

### 5. A Building
- Implement a `Building` class

### 6. Inheritance
- Practice class inheritance

### 7. Airport
- Create an `Airport` class

### 8. Primitive - Holberton Class
- Implement valueOf and toString methods

### 9. Hoisting
- Understand class hoisting behavior

### 10. Vroom
- Implement a `Car` class

- Proper docstrings everywhere
- Type hints on all the things!

### 🧩 Challenge Roadmap
1. Basic type hints - Start simple
2. Function typing - Parameters & returns
3. Number games - Floats and floors
4. String theory - With types!
5. Complex types - Lists, tuples, mixtures
6. Duck typing - Quack quack!

### 💡 Pro Tip
"Type hints are like training wheels - they help prevent falls but don't slow you down!"
